## Pacman - game
Poor JavaScript edition of Pacman arcade game, written in 2-3 days during first months of Coronavirus pandemic. I coded it in 2020 for Client Applications course in Upper-Secondary Schools of Communications.
## Some things that I learned:
- pathfinding alghoritms, especially A*
- keeping code fairly clean
- work under stress
